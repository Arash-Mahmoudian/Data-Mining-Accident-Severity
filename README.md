<h2>Introduction</h2>
The financial and societal impact of traffic accidents exceeds hundreds of billions of dollars every year. Therefore, reducing these accidents, remarkably major ones, is always an important challenge. For this, understanding the nature of these incidents can help to take proactive actions and reduce the size of the impact. This can be done in diverse approaches. One approach is accident severity prediction. In this project, the US Car Accident dataset collected from more than four million accidents all over the nation was used to build a Machin Leaning model to predict accident severity. The dataset is available in Kaggle.https://www.kaggle.com/code/jingzongwang/usa-car-accidents-severity-prediction

<h2>Road Map</h2>
The first aim of this study is to find the key factors of an accidentâ€™s severity. After determining these key factors, we will attempt to build a model which enables us to predict the severity of the accident. To achieve these goals first the dataset will be loaded, then the data quality will be thoroughly examined, and corrective clean-ups will be applied to it if needed. Next, once the data is successfully cleaned up, the Data Exploratory Analysis will be performed to extract the hidden insights/relation between its attributes.
